# fault-detection-project
In industry 4.0, AI plays a huge role in identifying the faults in the machinery which results in reduced costs and downtime. In this project, a one class support vector machine model has been trained on the normal class, and tested for the dataset containing both normal and faulty observations. The idea is for the model to classify anything that is different from normal behaviour as an anomaly.

The dataset is aquired from kaggle, called as Industrial equipment monitoring dataset.
